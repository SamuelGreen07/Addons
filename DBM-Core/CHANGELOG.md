[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/compare/9.0.2...39c6783458e36a8708413b9b252baa409a6814c0) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/releases)

- Forgot to unregister the now unused event.  
- Completely remove support for timertracker object from DBM. When it's no longer a DBM feature, DBM might eventually stop getting blamed when it breaks from uses not caused by DBM.  
- Fix a missed replacement  
- Full drycode of Valinor, the most dangerous of the 4 shadowlands world bosses. Although despite my best effort, I know in my gut this boss is going to be a nightmare for griefing and high pop servers that'll result in nerfs the first time it's up. Blizzard didn't learn from oondasta apparently.  
- Just another weekly update to Council, since blizzard is still in alpha stages of this fight apparently.  
- Prep Shadowlands world boss module  
- two initial timer adjustments on jaina with new min times
