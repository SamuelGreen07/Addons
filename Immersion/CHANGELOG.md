- Allow for restricted gossip options on Retail  
    Fixes the issue where some NPCs provide gossip options that are unclickable with Immersion loaded, as a relatively new restriction has been placed on some gossip options to prevent selecting a specific gossip ID. The addition was intended to address an issue in mythic Court of Stars where addons and weakauras could bypass the spy mechanic.
